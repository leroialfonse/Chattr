# Chattr - a chat app!

Here's the seeds to a chat app I'm thinking about. I was inspired to work on this project after an interview opportunity that... was not as smooth as it should have been. So, I wanted to spend some time ironing out some wrinkles with my understanding of the code for this kind of app. I even had a spark of inspiration for another project that I want to think about that I will be able to use the same technologies to accomplish.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Socket.io

So, this project was, like I said earlier, inspired by an inteview. I realized that I didn't have a solid enough grasp on what should have been easier. So, I dug in to socket.io, to get a better handle on real-time interactivity, and Web Sockets.

## Optimizations

Since this is just the first baby steps with socket.io, and the first steps with a chat app, I'll be coming back to really flesh this out and dive deeper into socket.io's functionality. I plan on adding different rooms, an active users menu, private messsaging, and maybe even a friends list. There's a long list of bells and whistles I can imagine would work well here.

## Lessons Learned:

The big learning area was socekt.io and it's functionality. I've barely scratched the surface, but there's SO MUCH MORE I want to get into.
